# ðŸ§± AFIâ€‘Construct

**AFIâ€‘Construct** is the public simulation and blueprint layer of the AFI Protocol â€” a white-room environment for rehearsing DAG pipelines and modular agent interactions.

This repo is open to contributors and Factory.ai droids to:
- Define DAGs and pipeline topologies
- Simulate signal flows or scoring logic
- Test blueprints before theyâ€™re hardened in `afi-core`

## Position in the Protocol

```
afi-labs (private experiments) âžœ afi-construct (public simulation) âžœ afi-core (production logic)
```

Use this repo like The Construct from *The Matrix*: a safe space to simulate the unreal, until it becomes real.
